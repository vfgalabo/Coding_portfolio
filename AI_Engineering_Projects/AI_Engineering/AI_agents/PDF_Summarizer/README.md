# PDF Summarizer and Reader

This project is a Streamlit application that provides a powerful way to interact with PDF documents. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to allow users to upload a PDF and ask questions about its content.

## 📄 Features

* **PDF Upload and Processing**: Users can upload any PDF file, which the application then processes by splitting it into manageable chunks.
* **Semantic Search**: A **FAISS vector store** and **Google Gemini embeddings** are used to perform a semantic search, retrieving the most relevant sections of the document to answer a user's query.
* **Advanced Q&A**: The application uses a **"refine" chain** to provide coherent and context-aware answers, ensuring that the model understands the document's content as a whole, rather than just isolated fragments.
* **Streamlit UI**: A simple and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vsbunny/AI_agents.git](https://github.com/vsbunny/AI_agents.git)
    cd AI_agents/PDF_Summarizer
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Up API Key**:
    You will need a Google Gemini API key. It's recommended to store this in your environment variables.
    * Create a `.env` file or use your system's environment variables.
    * Alternatively, you can manually enter the key when prompted by the application.

4.  **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run pdf_app.py
    ```

### The Application in Action

This screenshot shows the application after a user has uploaded a PDF chapter and submitted a query. The agent's response demonstrates its ability to synthesize information from the document to provide a comprehensive answer.

### 🤝 Development and Resource Management Acknowledgment

This RAG application was built using a **co-development workflow** with technical assistance from **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (a generative AI model by Google). 
The development process involved distinct roles for the repository owner and Gemini, focusing on architecture, implementation, optimization, and refinement.
---
#### 👩🏻‍💻 Repository Owner's Role (Architecture, Implementation, & Optimization)
* **Core RAG Architecture:** **Designed and implemented the initial RetrievalQA chain** using the `refine` strategy, and established the secure data flow from PDF to Vector Store.
* **Modular Implementation:** **Integrated and finalized the modular structure** (moving logic to `agent_core.py` and I/O to `core/tools.py`), ensuring all components function seamlessly.
* **Policy Optimization:** Implementing and testing the security hardening for file handling (temporary file usage) and actively mitigating embedding failure scenarios.
* **Quality Assurance:** Validating the agent's end-to-end functionality and tuning the application for optimal user experience.

#### 🤖 Gemini's Role (Refinement & Consultation)
* **Conceptual Refinement:** Advising on the final file architecture and implementing **Streamlit Secrets** management for security compliance.
* **Robustness & Error Management:** Consulting on and implementing solutions for robust file loading (Pypdf integration) and advising on the graceful handling of API quota constraints.
* **Code Debugging:** Assisting with the final debugging of subtle Python scope and Streamlit execution issues.
---
#### ⚠️ Note on Embedding Quotas
    
Due to the constraints of the Google **Embedding API's free-tier quota**, the application may intermittently return a `429 Quota Exceeded` error when attempting to process new PDF documents. 
This is a common **rate-limiting constraint** applied by API providers to resource-intensive services. The application's design successfully handles this error, protecting the system from crashes, 
and will resume full functionality after the daily quota resets.
